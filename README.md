## üî≠ About Me

I specialize in leveraging cutting-edge technologies, with a strong preference for **open-source solutions**, to architect and implement solutions that solve complex challenges and streamline operations. With a robust foundation in **AWS, GCP, Azure, Terragrunt, Terraform, and Python**, I excel at creating sophisticated automation that minimizes manual intervention and maximizes system reliability.

A significant part of my work involves designing infrastructure that rigorously adheres to stringent compliance and security standards. I'm experienced in managing and optimizing multi-cloud environments and on-premise solutions, including my personal homelab (powered by Proxmox), always aiming for consistency, cost-efficiency, and peak performance.

I am a firm believer in **Agile methodologies** and am dedicated to continuous learning and process improvement, especially in the rapidly evolving field of **Artificial Intelligence**.
